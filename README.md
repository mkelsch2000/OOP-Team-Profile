# OOP-Team-Profile

For the Object-Oriented Programming Challenge, I was tasked with developing a program that takes user input, and produces an HTML document that shows employee cards, and the employees data within each card. The assignment gave me an optional blueprint to use when structuring my files. After getting the files all setup, I dove right into Test Driven Development, making sure that I could get the data I want for each employee type. Next I created a bunch of prototypes from a base class known as "Questions", within each prototype I used inquire to ask questions, then compiled the data and sent it into separate class specific files to generate the HTML data depending on each class. That data is then returned to their function calls, and used to produce the HTML document required for the assignment.
